            During the summer before my graduating year, I found myself desperately seeking a job. I was hopeless and took to binge-watching Madmen during the time that I wasn't re-writing my resume. 
            <p>While that was a great show, I also wanted to do something productive with my time. Guess what I started doing - Learning to code! 
                </p>
                <p>I took free courses online and realized that it was quite fun. However, I soon found a job and didn't have as much time to code anymore. Once school started my studies occupied my time and coding was just not on my schedule.

                </p> 
                <p>2 years later I find myself re-visiting my coding journey in this Coding BootCamp. I hope to learn loads, build my own website and pursue a career in data analytics with the new skills that I will gain from this program. </p>
